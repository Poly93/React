## _E-Commerce - Lubricentro Stocco_

This website is powered by React, HTML5, Firebase, Bootstrap and is mobile-ready too.


## Features

- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.
